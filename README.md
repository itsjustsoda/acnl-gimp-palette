# Animal Crossing: New Leaf Gimp Palette
This is a .gpl GIMP palette of the colors in the Animal Crossing: New Leaf designer.
The palette is ordered into groups of nine like the color picker in game and each color is labeled with its value in the pattern binaries.

### Credits
This is based on [garrett's palette](https://github.com/garrett/Animal-Crossing-design/blob/master/palette/AC-NL.gpl) and I used [thulinma's editor](http://www.thulinma.com/acnl/) to help me associate the colors with their values.
