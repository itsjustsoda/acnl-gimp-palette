# Animal Crossing: New Leaf Gimp Palette
A .gpl palette of the colors in the Animal Crossing: New Leaf designer.
The palette is ordered into groups of nine like the color picker in game and each color is labeled with its value in the pattern binaries.
This is based on [garrett's palette](https://github.com/garrett/Animal-Crossing-design/blob/master/palette/AC-NL.gpl) and I used [thulinma's editor](http://www.thulinma.com/acnl/) to help me associate the colors with their values.
